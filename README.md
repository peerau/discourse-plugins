# My Discourse plugins repository
This repository is containing a batch of my template embedded plugins for Discourse.
All of those plugins are under GNU GPL 3.0 Licence.

I have developed most of them for a Multigaming Community called Daerie.
You may see them live on our [forum](https://forums.clandaerie.com).

With recent changed applied to Discourse and the introduce of template components,
it make their integration easier.

In case you're liking this work, be free to send me some ISK under EVE Online on `Warlof Tutsimo` in case you're an EVE player.
If you're using any of those plugin, please tell me where and I'll add your discourse here :)
